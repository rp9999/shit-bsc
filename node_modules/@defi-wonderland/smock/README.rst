**Smock** is the **S**\ olidity **mock**\ ing library.
It's a plugin for `hardhat <https://hardhat.org>`_ that can be used to create mock Solidity contracts entirely in JavaScript (or TypeScript!).
With Smock, it's easier than ever to test your smart contracts.
You'll never have to write another mock contract in Solidity again.

Smock is inspired by `sinon <https://sinonjs.org>`_, `sinon-chai <https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/sinon-chai>`_, and Python's `unittest.mock <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html>`_.
Although Smock is currently only compatible with `hardhat <https://hardhat.org>`_, we plan to extend support to other testing frameworks like `Truffle <https://www.trufflesuite.com/>`_.

Features
--------

* Get rid of your folder of "mock" contracts and **just use JavaScript**.
* Keep your tests **simple** with a sweet set of chai matchers.
* Fully compatible with TypeScript and TypeChain.
* Manipulate the behavior of functions on the fly with **fakes**.
* Modify functions and internal variables of a real contract with **mocks**.
* Make **assertions** about calls, call arguments, and call counts.
* We've got extensive documentation and a complete test suite.

Documentation
-------------

Detailed documentation can be found `here <https://smock.readthedocs.io>`_.

Quick Start

Installation
************

You can install Smock via npm or yarn:

.. code-block:: console

    npm install @defi-wonderland/smock

Basic Usage
***********

Smock is dead simple to use.
Here's a basic example of how you might use it to streamline your tests.

.. code-block:: typescript

    ...
    import { FakeContract, smock } from '@defi-wonderland/smock';

    chai.should(); // if you like should syntax
    chai.use(smock.matchers);

    describe('MyContract', () => {
        let myContractFake: FakeContract<MyContract>;

        beforeEach(async () => {
            ...
            myContractFake = await smock.fake('MyContract');
        });

        it('some test', () => {
            myContractFake.bark.returns('woof');
            ...
            myContractFake.bark.atCall(0).should.be.calledWith('Hello World');
        });
    });
